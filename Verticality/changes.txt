- Changed how I do versioning; please don't be alarmed by the sudden jump by 3 minor versions

- Patched up some cases where you could grab through another block
- Now possible to grab overhangs (currently somewhat limited, needs more work)

- Added option for player to stop crawling when pressing jump (enabled by default)
- Added option for player to start crawling by double-tapping sneak (disabled by default)
